The badge for the app icons was achieved by positioning it relative, tweaking the top position, applying a background image and reducing the bottom margin to position the caption text.
The hover method on the .icon along with the + selector was used to enlarge the badge, replacing the dimensions and background image with larger ones along with modifications to the margins and positioning.

Side menu and content layout was achieved by applying a fixed width property (180) to the nav ul menu and floating it left while allowing the content section to fit alongside it with a minus margin setting. 
The vertically filling background effect was achieved by placing the content sections in a div which has the background color of the side menu while the main div containing all of the content elements has the background color of the content.

The updated badge in the header was selected using header div (as it was the only div contained within header)
It was positioned fixed and set with top and right positioning. The z-index is set to allow it to cover the heading
